# MyCrazyVerseLearningJourney
My personal experience journal learning Verse seems unlikely to be of interest, but there may be bits here and there

It is hard to learn a new programming language in a rigorous in-depth manner and keeping this journal might help in those many moments where my eyes glaze over and watching grass grow is more interesting.

# Below this point, entries are in reverse chronological order


### Launching Verse, a major new programming language inside of UEFN

At first it seemed awkward. But at least the usual PRINT ( "HELLO WORLD") could be far more entertaining with an NPC that dances around saying Hello World!

### Rollback of every if statement

Seems like a mental burden that could build up in a large body of code. We shall see...

### not not
"You can use not not expression as a way to check if an expression will succeed but make it so the expression never happens."
- it just seems like an awkward side effect and should be something like test(expression) but every language designer of any worth agonizes over every new keyword added so every programing language has these awkward bits that lurk in the backwaters...

### 0 is not equal to 0.0
"0 = 0.0 - This example will fail because 0 is of type int, while 0.0 is of type float, and int and float do not share a subtyping relationship."

### Creator Portal Epic Support Really Sucks
I have hit a snag with my Creator Account where they want to know that I am actually well .. me. I don't travel or drive a car so I have lived my entire life without a Passport, Driver's License and Identity Card. I will attempt to contact Epic Support and see what sort of adventure I need to embark on to become "me" - I felt a horrible sense of disappointment when I was informed that I was not actually a real person and i'm not looking forward to how long that might take to fix but logically I am a long way from making a useful demo of an island that illustrates Verse usage anyways. Still it did make me pause and reconsider the entire idea. First attempt at a support request is a dismal failure. They just repeated back boilerplate text without bothering to read what I said!

### Useful reference?
I assembled a reference page so I can keep track of Verse info that I come across:
- https://github.com/VerseMetaVerse/VerseInfo
- Lots of small updates - I need to switch my focus to the actual learning of Verse.  Since it starts out in life as "scripting" for UEFN, there are no large code projects that can really help with learning. So that is my first objective - make something useful that can become a large module to help people. All suggestions welcome.


### NEWBIE MISTAKE 1:
I have never used Fortnite before but since the sale of digital "skins" is paying for all the goodies that Epic is giving us, we should encourage everyone to do that so then where you pay for the skin there is a [HOLD] marker and clicking the button does nothing. So I google like crazy to figure out how my Epic Account can be on hold just for Fortnite and it is actually a common issue with Microsoft Store with XBOX users but I can't find anything. So it's not critical but I stared at it for 2 days since I was leaving it open to qualify for the Creator Program and then I thought, maybe it isn't an account problem. ANSWER: Click on yellow area and HOLD down the mouse button! (No comments on UX Design and I'm being laughed at by Fortnite players around the world)

### The Captivating Idea
The idea of "vast open worlds built by millions of creators for billions of players" has completely captured and inspired me. There is an actual profession of "Futurism" where people try to predict in rational scientific ways how things will progress and they never get it right. Every few decades our computer industry engages in large competitions for dominance of platforms. I think we are in a ramp-up phase to "The Metaverse Wars" that will play out in the next decade. I really like Sweeney's vision and I dislike Zuckerburg's and I am not sure who else will attempt a platform play, perhaps Amazon or Google.
